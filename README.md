Adds a noteblock sound of a choir when a noteblock is placed on soul sand
Feeling inspired by this [reddit feature request](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/gv6phl/note_blocks_on_soul_sand_should_play_choir_noises/) I made a noteblock that makes a choir sound when placed on soul sand.
  
To play the original sound the soul sand made(cow_bell) place the noteblock on a quartz block.

That's all the feature it adds, but it might make for some interesting music combinations.
